# SPARTA-STRESSA
## NOTICE ##
--Windows may initially flag the program as a threat. To get around this; 
simply double click the notification> click the file name > click allow on device > click start actions


Allows the user to stress individual ipv4 addresses or html websites. This is for ethical hacking only, and I am not responsible for any misuse with the code.

After installation, perform the following:

1) Run the "SPARTA_STRESSA.exe" file
2) Select the targetted ip adress / web adress.
3) Press "TARGET"
4) Select on the drop down box whether you would like to perform the attack using udp/tcp for ip's, and html for web adresses.
5) Select the amount of cores you would like to attack with. The more cores, the more you will stress the target.
6) Hit "ATTACK" and watch your target burn >:))







ENJOY :))
